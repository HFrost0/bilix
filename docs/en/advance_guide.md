# Advance Guide
Please use `bilix -h` for more help，including method shorthand，video quality selection，concurrency control，
download speed control，download directory...

## Method shorthand

Method names like get_series and get_video are too cumbersome to write? Agreed! You can use their
shorthand for faster access:

```shell
bilix s 'url'
bilix v 'url'
...
```
please check `bilix -h` for all shorthands

## Login

there are two ways to login

* cookie option

  By adding the `SESSDATA` cookie from your browser's cache in the `--cookie` option, you can download videos that require a premium membership.

* load cookies from browser

  After logging in through the browser, use the `-fb --from-browser` option to read cookies from the browser,
  such as `-fb chrome`. Using this method may require authorization. The method that `bilix` uses to read browser
  cookies is the open-source project [browser_cookie3](https://github.com/borisbabic/browser_cookie3).  

:::tip
If you want to keep logged in, you can use `alias bilix=bilix --cookie xxxxxx` or `alias bilix=bilix -fb chrome`
to create an alias for the `bilix` command

## Video and audio quality, codec selection

You can use `--quality -q`option to choose video resolution，bilix supports two different selection ways：

* relatively choose (default)

  By default, bilix will select the accessible highest quality for you (that is, `-q 0`), for the second, use `-q 1` to specify, the larger number the lower resolution.
  When the number out of index, the lowest quality will be is selected. For example, you can always select the lowest quality by `-q 999`.
* absolute choose

  You can use`-q 1080P` to specific a resolution, the string is a substring of the resolution name on bilibili.

For more advanced users who may need to specify a particular video codec for download, the encodings supported by Bilibili are not visible on the website or in the app. For this purpose, bilix has designed the `info` method. By using it, you can fully understand all the information about the video:

```text
bilix info 'https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1kG411t72J' --cookie 'xxxxx'

looks good😇，so how can I download the video with the specified codec?

bilix provides another option `--codec`. For example, you can use a combination like `-q 480P --codec hev1.1.6.L120.90`
to specify downloading the 7.61MB one. The `--codec` option is similar to the `-q` option which supports substring specification,
for example using `--codec hev` to make all videos choose codec that start with hev.

For audio quality, some videos may contain Dolby and Hi-Res audio. You can use the `--codec` option to specify these
audio formats, for example:

```shell
bilix v 'https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1kG411t72J' --cookie 'xxxxx' --codec hev:fLaC 
```

in `--codec hev:fLaC`, use`:` to split video and audio codec, if you just want to specify audio codec，you can use`--codec :fLaC`

## Resuming Interrupted Downloads

Users can interrupt tasks by pressing `Ctrl+C`. For unfinished files, re-executing the command will resume the download
based on the previous progress, and completed files will be skipped. However, for unfinished files, it is recommended
to clear the temporary files of the unfinished tasks before executing the command again in the following situations,
otherwise some temporary files may remain:

* Changing the video quality `-q` or `--codec` after interruption
* Changing the `--part-con` after interruption
* Changing the `--time-range` after interruption

## Support for More Sites

bilix also supports some other websites, but their availability may vary as the author is currently busy. 
For further information, please refer to the following [discussion](https://github.com/HFrost0/bilix/discussions/39).

## Basic Download method
For some basic download scenarios
* You can directly download a file through the file url
  ```shell
  bilix f 'https://xxxx.com/xxxx.mp4'
  ```
* you can directly download m3u8 video by url
  ```shell
  bilix m3u8 'https:/xxxx.com/xxxx.m3u8'
  ```
